TITLE: Does the US gov't have the right to force tobacco companies to put warning pictures on their boxes?
POST: I was reading [this article] about how the US government is trying to make tobacco companies put "grotesque" warning pictures on their cigarette boxes.

The tobacco companies are saying that it's a violation of their first amendment rights to make them do that.

Aren't there already other countries that do this? It's been awhile since i've seen a pack of smokes outside of the US.

I also feel like that the majority of people know that smoking is bad for them and they still do it anyway. So are the pictures really going to change much in that regard. It's different from not being able to advertise, which is to get people to start smoking.

and if people are worried about the nasty looking pictures maybe I'm just desensitized to those things but they don't bother me.

the article also states that if smoking was discovered/invented today and the government knew about the health risks it would get pulled from the store shelves in a heartbeat. i suppose you can compare banning smoking to prohibition, and i know drinking isn't good for you specially in excess but smoking is far worse.
